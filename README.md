# Free-Non-Linear-Dynamics-of-1-dof-Pendulum
This work is basically numerical analysis of non linear behaviour of pendulum. There is no forcing occuring, and it's one degree of freedom. There is no linearization here, and therefore the differential equations are non linear and hence numerical solutions are computed using MATLAB.
